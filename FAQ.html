  <div class="box2 a">Q: How do you seperate hydrogen from oxygen in water?</div>
  <div class="box2 b">A: Electrolysis a method of separating elements by pushing an electric current through a compound. It is used in various industrial applications such as removing copper from its ore. It is also used to separate hydrogen and oxygen from water.</div>
  <div class="box2 c">Q: Can we use water as fuel?</div>
  <div class="box2 d">A: To fuel a hydrogen car from water, electricity is used to generate hydrogen by electrolysis. The resulting hydrogen is an energy carrier that can power a car by reacting with oxygen from the air to create water, either through burning in a combustion engine or catalyzed to produce electricity in a fuel cell.</div>
  <div class="box2 e">Q: How will this machine help us in the future?</div>
  <div class="box2 f">A: It will make it so fuel is no longer an expensive necessity. It will make it so the poor will be able to easily get fuel for they're cars and other gas fueled appliances.</div>
