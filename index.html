  <div class="box content">If we're going to make a move away from fossil fuels, it's not going to happen overnight; too much of our existing infrastructure and technology is based on coal and petroleum, which would take a lot of time and money to replace. However, synthetic fuels would be a good interim option, especially if they could be cleanly produced as Sunfire GmbH has done. The Dresden-based cleantech company has unveiled a rig the first of its kind that uses what it calls "Power-to-Liquid" technology to convert H2O and CO2 into liquid hydrocarbons synthetic petrol, diesel and kerosene.</div>
